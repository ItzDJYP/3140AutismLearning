            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental
              condition that affects how a child thinks, communicates, and
              interacts with their world. It usually becomes noticeable in early
              childhood. Children with autism process information, routines,
              sensory input, and social cues in unique ways. While many enjoy
              predictability or have focused interests, others may struggle with
              communication or sensory experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, approximately 1 in 31 children in the U.S. is diagnosed
              with autism, and globally, about 1 in 100 children. These figures
              reflect better awareness, enhanced screening, and broader
              diagnostic standards—autism isn’t more common, but we’re better at
              identifying it. Kids of all backgrounds and identities can be
              autistic, and although diagnosed more often in boys, girls may be
              under-identified.

            <h3>Levels of Support</h3>
            <p>
              When diagnosing autism, clinicians describe how much help a child
              needs right now using three levels. These levels help guide the
              type and amount of support each child receives, and they may
              change over time.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 1 (Requiring Support):</strong> Everyday
                independence is possible with some help—for instance, with
                social interactions, flexibility, or planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 2 (Requiring Substantial Support):</strong> More
                noticeable challenges with communication and behavior; needs
                consistent support across settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Level 3 (Requiring Very Substantial Support):</strong>
                Significant daily challenges with communication, routines, and
                behavior—intensive help is needed most of the day.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This level system replaces older “high-functioning” or
              “low-functioning” labels, which can be misleading. It emphasizes
              each child’s current needs rather than generalizations.

            <h3>Signs &amp; Screening</h3>
            <p>
              Between ages 4–6, children’s social and communication skills
              become more complex. Watching how your child plays and interacts
              can reveal subtle signs of autism that may emerge in preschool
              years.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Social interaction:</strong> Prefers playing alone,
                avoids imaginative or cooperative play, doesn’t respond when
                name is called, limited eye contact, doesn’t share interest or
                emotions with others (like showing toys or pointing things out).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Communication &amp; language:</strong> Has difficulty
                forming sentences, uses repetitive phrases, reverses pronouns
                (“you” instead of “I”), speaks in flat or singsong voice,
                struggles with gestures or understanding jokes/sarcasm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anxiety around change or routines:</strong> Becomes
                upset at minor changes (like a different snack), insists on
                sameness, shows distress over small transitions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Repetitive behaviors or narrow interests:</strong> Lines
                up toys or objects in exact order, repeats certain actions,
                intensely focused on specific topics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sensory differences:</strong> Reacts strongly to sounds,
                textures, or lights—may cover ears, dislike wearing certain
                clothes, or avoid messy play.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Red Flags in Everyday Milestones</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Still not using sentences consistently, or using very few words
                by age 4.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rarely plays pretend—like pretending to cook, talk on toy
                phones, or acting out stories.
              </li>
              <li>
                Doesn’t seek comfort from familiar adults—or seems “tuned out”
                of social interactions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Screening Tools for Ages 4–6</h4>
            <p>
              For preschoolers and early school-age children, tools like the
              <strong>CAST (Childhood Autism Spectrum Test)</strong> and the
              <strong>SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire)</strong> help
              identify communication and social patterns typical in this age
              group.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The CAST is a parent-completed questionnaire for kids aged 4–11.
                It measures social, communication, play, and repetitive
                behaviors in about 5–10 minutes. A higher score may indicate the
                need for a full evaluation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The SCQ is another parent-based tool for ages 4 and older,
                focusing on recent behaviors and communication skills.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Trust your instincts—if you notice these signs, bring them up at
              your child’s next pediatric visit. Early screening and evaluation
              can lead to better-tailored support and brighter outcomes.

            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>
              When autism isn't caught early, it often becomes clearer during
              preschool years. Around ages 4–6, parents and teachers may notice
              ongoing differences in how a child interacts with others, plays,
              speaks, or adapts to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              A formal diagnosis involves a team of trusted professionals—like
              developmental pediatricians, child psychologists, speech-language
              therapists, and sometimes occupational therapists. The evaluation
              is a careful process, using multiple tools and observations to
              understand your child's unique strengths and challenges.
            </p>

            <h4>What to Expect During Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Caregiver interview:</strong> You may be asked about
                your child’s development milestones, language and play history,
                behaviors, and how they handle daily routines or changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Direct observation:</strong> Clinicians often use
                structured tools like the ADOS-2, where they play with your
                child and look for signs of social communication differences,
                imaginative play, and repetitive behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rating scales:</strong> Tools like CARS (Childhood
                Autism Rating Scale) help professionals rate behavior on traits
                like emotional response, adaptation to change, and
                communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Screening tools review:</strong> Questionnaires like the
                CAST or SCQ—completed by you—provide snapshots of social,
                communication, and imaginative play behaviors typical at this
                age.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Developmental testing:</strong> Your child may be
                evaluated for language, thinking, and daily living skills to
                understand cognitive strengths and areas needing support.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Medical checks as needed:</strong> Often includes
                hearing tests, and in some cases, genetic testing to identify
                any underlying genetic conditions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why a Thorough Evaluation Matters</h4>
            <p>
              Accurate diagnosis by a skilled team ensures the support matches
              your child’s unique needs—whether that’s school planning, daily
              routines at home, or therapies that promote social and language
              skills. Many children receive a reliable diagnosis around ages 4–5
              when signs become clearer, so it’s perfectly valid to seek
              evaluation even if earlier screenings were inconclusive.

              Early help matters. Research shows that intervention begun in
              early childhood—including behavioral, speech, and occupational
              therapies—can significantly improve communication, social skills,
              and daily routines.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Behavioral Therapy:</strong> Supports positive behaviors
                and social skills through structured and play-based methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Speech-Language Therapy:</strong> Helps children
                communicate—whether by words, gestures, or picture-based
                systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Occupational Therapy:</strong> Supports sensory
                regulation, motor skills, self-care, and daily routines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Early Intervention Programs:</strong> Collaborative
                services that support both child and family, ideally beginning
                in toddler years.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Every child is unique—so therapies should be individualized,
              respectful, and empowering, aiming to help children learn,
              participate, and build independence at home, school, and beyond.

                <strong>Myth:</strong> Vaccines cause autism. <br /><strong
                  >Fact:</strong
                >
                Multiple large, peer-reviewed studies—across different countries
                and involving millions of children—have found no connection
                between vaccines (including the MMR vaccine and those with
                thimerosal) and autism. The original study that claimed a link
                was found to be fraudulent and was retracted.

              <li>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> Autism is a mental illness or a disease.
                <br /><strong>Fact:</strong> Autism is a neurodevelopmental
                difference—it’s part of how a child’s brain works, not a disease
                to be cured.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> All autistic children are the same or
                have special talents like being geniuses. <br /><strong
                  >Fact:</strong
                >
                Autism is a wide spectrum. Some children may have intense
                interests or excel in certain areas, but others may struggle
                with language or social skills. Every child’s profile is unique.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> Only boys are autistic. <br /><strong
                  >Fact:</strong
                >
                Autistic individuals include all genders. Girls, in particular,
                may “mask” their differences and are often diagnosed later than
                boys.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> Autism can be cured. <br /><strong
                  >Fact:</strong
                >
                Autism is lifelong and not something to cure. However, early
                supports—like therapies focused on communication, play, and
                daily living skills—can help children thrive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Myth:</strong> Autistic children don’t want friends or
                emotional connection. <br /><strong>Fact:</strong>
                Many autistic children want friendships, but they may interact
                or show emotions differently—through routines, play, or their
                own way of expressing feeling.

            <h3>What Is Autism? (For Kids)</h3>
            <p>
              Autism means your brain works in a special way that makes you,
              you! Here’s what that can mean:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some sounds, lights, or textures might feel extra strong or
                different—and that’s okay.
              </li>
              <li>
                You might love the same routine, like playing the same game or
                line of toys. That’s your special interest!
              </li>
              <li>
                You might talk, move, or play in ways that are different—and
                that makes you unique.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Being autistic means seeing the world differently—and that’s one
              of the many wonderful ways there are to be.
