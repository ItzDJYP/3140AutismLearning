      <p>
        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects
        how people communicate, interact, and experience the world. Every person
        with autism is unique, and their abilities and challenges vary.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h3>
      <p>
        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
        characterized by differences in social communication, behavior, and
        sensory processing. People with autism may experience the world in
        unique ways, and their strengths and challenges can vary widely.
      </p>

      <h3>Levels of Autism</h3>
      <p>
        ASD is categorized into three levels based on the amount of support an
        individual needs. These levels help professionals tailor interventions
        and support strategies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 1: Requiring Support</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              May have difficulty initiating social interactions and responding
              to social cues.
            </li>
            <li>
              May struggle with organization and planning, which can impact
              independence.
            </li>
            <li>Communication challenges may be noticeable but less severe.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 2: Requiring Substantial Support</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication
              skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Social interactions are limited to narrow interests or specific
              topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repetitive behaviors and difficulty coping with change are more
              apparent.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 3: Requiring Very Substantial Support</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Severe deficits in social communication and interaction.</li>
            <li>
              Very limited ability to engage in social activities or respond to
              others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extreme difficulty coping with change; repetitive behaviors are
              highly restrictive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
